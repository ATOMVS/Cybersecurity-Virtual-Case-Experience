Create and submit a PowerPoint slide deck for Stefan answering step 2 and 3. For the first step, use the memo function of your phone and upload a voicemail to complete your task.

1. To learn more about Boldi AG and its culture, you first need to determine who you should talk to at Boldi AG and what the content of these interviews should be. How does your agenda differ based on the audience, e.g. management vs. engineers? Stefan is currently in a meeting, leave him a voicemail (no longer than 1.5 minutes).

2. Now you are prepared to conduct an information risk impact assessment. In the meantime, you discover that Boldi AG files on paper and the companyâ€™s cloud-based information systems are inconsistent in format and hard to use for an analysis. Plus, there are no controls over who in the company can access these files. 

Does any of this present an information security concern? Please explain your answer in the slide deck. Think of this through the prism of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) and add slides to your started presentation.

3. After you know enough about Boldi AG, decide what type of risk assessment would be best, a quantitative risk assessment or a qualitative risk assessment. Then explain the difference between quantitative and qualitative assessments. What do you rely on to be able to perform a quantitative assessment? Which method could be more adapted for information security risk assessments?
