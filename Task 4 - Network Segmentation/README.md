Submit a Microsoft Word document with both parts in it to finalise your work.

Part 1

For Stefans preparation, write in Microsoft Word format detailed notes explaining how segmentation contributes to network security and to the security of the whole organisation. Your notes will help Stefan creating the workshop

Part 2

The  Head of IT Infrastructure of Boldi AG provided Stefan with the following network segmentation:

Domain: A namespace which logically divides an organisationâ€™s network objects that share the same directory.

Admin Zone: Special purpose server zone, e.g. central logging, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

Server Zone: General purpose server zone, e.g. application servers, database servers

Client Zone: General purpose client zone, e.g. user laptops

Regarding network segmentation and trust architectures, the base configuration and maintenance of firewalls is of great importance. There are two approaches to configuring firewalls: whitelisting the good or blacklisting the bad.

Add to your notes how firewalls A, B, C and D at Boldi AG need to be configured using the concepts of whitelisting and blacklisting and why.
